        <h3>1. Making my own website!</h3>
        <p style="text-align: right;">Date: 11/04/2022</p>
        <p>I have been thinking of making a website for years now but never had the energy nor time to do so.
        <br>Finally I got some time and now I am learning web development whilst making my own website UwU.
        <br>Special thanks to GitHub for providing such a lovely service free of cost to host my website upon.
        <br>The code for the website is being hosted <a href="https://github.com/acidicneko/acidicneko.github.io">here</a>.
